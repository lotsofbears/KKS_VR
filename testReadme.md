# KKS_VR - VR Plugin for Koikatsu and Koikatsu Sunshine
A BepInEx plugin for Koikatsu (KK) and Koikatsu Sunshine (KKS) that allows you to play the main game and studio (Sunshine only) in VR.
The difference from the official VR modules is that you have access to the full game/studio, while the official modules have limited features and spotty mod support.

Currently only the standing (aka room-scale) mode is fully supported.

The main game part is a fork/port of the KoikatuVR/KK_MainGameVR plugin developed by mosirnik, vrhth, KoikatsuVrThrowaway and Ooetksh.

The studio part is a fork of the [KKS_CharaStudioVR](https://vr-erogamer.com/archives/1065) plugin.

## Prerequisites

* Koikatsu or Koikatsu Sunshine
* Latest version of BepInEx 5.x and KKSAPI/ModdingAPI
* SteamVR
* A VR headset supported by SteamVR
* VR controllers


## Installation

1. Make sure BepInEx, KKSAPI and all their dependencies have been installed.
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KKS_VR/releases) for the corresponding game.
3. Extract the zip into the game folder (where the abdata and BepInEx folders are).
4. Create a shortcut to Koikatu.exe and/or KoikatsuSunshine.exe and/or CharaStudio.exe, and add `--vr` to the command line.  
   The game (not the studio) also can be launched without any added arguments if SteamVR is running.

## Tip
 * Be advised to set InterPupillary Distance (IPD) in the settings to change the scale of the world according to a personal preference and used hardware.

## Controls Game
### Overview

There are two controllers for each hand with identical functional without any tools or modes.  
There is no input customization or helping texts.  
Designed to be able to do any action with a single hand.  
The only means of movement are native in-game functions and *GripMove*, no *Warp*.  
No double clicks, only *Short* or *LongPress*.  
The sole function of *Menu* button is to toggle menu's visibility.  
The plugin assumes that VR controller has the following buttons:
* **Grip** used as a **Grab** button. It grabs things to move them around.  
* **Trigger** used as an **Action** button that performs actions where applicable or completes their wait period if one is already queued but not yet determined whether it's *Short* or *LongPress*.  
* **Touchpad** aka *Thumbstick* aka *Joystick* used as a **Generic** button. Never requires a click in non-centered positions.

### Modules and their inputs:

### GripMove  
Grab the world and move around oneself.  
Available in **Any Scene** as the last priority action i.e. when no better actions are available.   
* **Grip** to start *GripMove*.  
* **Trigger** while in *GripMove* to manipulate **Yaw** while using controller as an axis.  
* **Touchpad** while in *GripMove* with pressed *Trigger* to manipulate **Rotation** of the camera.  
* **Touchpad** while in *GripMove* without pressed *Trigger* to become **Upright**. Registers after *LongPress*.

Depending on the context may behave differently.  

### Impersonation aka PoV
Assume orientation of a character's head and loosely follow it.  
Available in **H Scene** outside of character interactions.  
* **Touchpad** to start, stop, change or reset *Impersonation*. Registers after *LongPress*.  
* **Touchpad** while in *Impersonation* and in *GripMove* with pressed *Trigger* to enable remote following with current vector between the camera and a character's head as an offset.  

Has settings for gender preferences and automatization.

### Assisted kiss/lick
Attach the camera to a partner's PoI to follow it.  
Available in **H Scene** when the camera is in direct proximity to the said PoI. Outside of caress positions requires *GripMove*.  
* **Grip** while *Assisted* to start altered version of *GripMove* to acquire precise offsets on the fly. The long gap between camera and PoI will cause disengagement.
* **Trigger** while *Assisted* and not in *GripMove* to stop action and disengage.

Has plenty of settings for customization. 

### Controller representation
Native in-game items serving as a representation of controllers.  
Available in **Any Scene** as the last priority action i.e. when no better actions are available.  
They won't go inside of things easily, preferring instead to stick to the surface.
* **Touchpad** with pressed *Trigger* to cycle available items.
* **DirectionHorizontal** with pressed *Trigger* to cycle through item's animations.

### IK Manipulator aka Grasp
Alter currently playing animation on the fly.  
Available in **H, Talk and Text Scenes** when interacting with a character i.e. controller is in close proximity to it.  
* **Grip** to start *Grasp* i.e. hold relevant body parts and reposition them with the controller movements.
* **Trigger** while in *Grasp* and visual cue of held body part is green to attach body part.  
  Currently only to self/different character or controller. ~~Hand holding.~~
* **Trigger** while in *Grasp* to extend the amount of held body parts, up to the whole character. Registers after *ShortPress*.
* **Trigger** while in *Grasp* to extend the amount of held body parts temporarily. Registers after *LongPress*.
* **Touchpad** while in *Grasp* to reset currently held body parts to default offsets.
* **Touchpad** while not in *Grasp* to reset relevant body part to the default offset. Registers after *LongPress*.
* **DirectionHorizontal** while in *Grasp* and the main held body part is a hand to scroll through hand animations. Goes full circle then resets to the animation's default.
* **DirectionHorizontal** while in *Grasp* and holding whole character to change *Yaw* of a character.
* **DirectionVertical** while in *Grasp* and holding whole character to move said character in direction of the camera.

### Menu interaction
Available in **Any Scene** when aiming controller at the floating in-game *Menu*.
* **Grip** to grab *Menu*.
* **Touchpad** while holding *Menu* with pressed *Trigger* to abandon it the world.
* **DirectionHorizontal** while holding *Menu* to change it's size.
* **DirectionVertical** while holding *Menu* to move it in controller's direction.

### H Interpreter
Available in **H Scene**, relies heavily on [SensibleH](https://github.com/lotsofbears/KK_SensibleH), without it many functions will be unavailable.  
Described horizonal directions assume the right controller, for the left controller the directions will be mirrored.

#### Generic
* **DirectionLeft** to choose random position of current category. Registers after *LongPress*. 
* **DirectionRight** to enter *PointMove*. Registers after *LongPress*.

* **Grip** on attached caress item while in *AutoCaress* to take manual control.
* **Trigger** on attached caress item to start *AutoCaress*. Registers after *LongPress*.
* **Trigger** on attached caress item while in *AutoCaress* to stop it.
* **Trigger** while in manual control of a caress item to squeeze. Might not always work if *AutoCaress* still runs some other item.
* **DirectionDown** on attached caress item while not in *AutoCaress* to detach it.

## Controls Studio
**Warning: This section was written for [KK_MainGameVR](https://github.com/mosirnik/KK_MainGameVR) and serves as a loose, vague reference for an actual functional.**

This plugin assumes that your VR controller has the following buttons/controls:

* Application menu button
* Trigger button
* Grip button
* Touchpad or Thumbstick

You may need to tweak button assignments in SteamVR's per-game settings if your
controllers don't natively have these. See the Controller Support section for
a list of known-to-work controllers.

In the game, each of the controllers has 3 tools: Menu, Warp and School/Hand. Only
one of them can be active at a time. You can cycle through the tools by pressing
the Application menu button. Each controller has a cyan icon indicating which
tool is currently active.

When any of the tools is active, you can press and hold the Application menu
button to see in-game help on button roles.

### Menu tool <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosirnik/KK_MainGameVR/master/doc/img/icon_menu.png" height="30">

The menu tool comes with a little screen on which game menus, icons and texts
are shown. You can use the other controller as a virtual laser pointer, and
pull the Trigger to click on the screen. Most game interactions (specifically,
the ones that don't involve touching 3D objects) are done this way.

Pressing the Grip button while the Menu tool is active causes the screen
to be detached and left at the current position in the 3D space. Pressing it
again reclaims the screen.

A laser pointer can also generate a right click (Touchpad right), middle click
(Touchpad center) and scroll up/down (Touchpad up/down). You can also grab
a detached screen by holding Grip. Press and hold the Application menu button
while the laser is visible to see help about this.

### Warp tool <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosirnik/KK_MainGameVR/master/doc/img/icon_warp.png" height="30">

The warp tool allows you to move around in the 3D space. 

Use the touchpad to teleport. Before you finish teleporting, you can draw a
circle along the rim of the trackpad (or similarly rotate the thumbstick)
to change your would-be orientation after teleporting.

Holding the Grip button takes you into grab action. Here you can move around
by "grabbing" the world. If you additionally press Trigger, you can also rotate
the world. Pressing both Trigger and the touchpad gives you the full power
of general 3D rotation, allowing you to turn a wall into the floor, for
example. Double click the touchpad to become upright again.

Grab action is also avaible in the school and hand tools.

### School tool <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosirnik/KK_MainGameVR/master/doc/img/icon_school.png" height="30"> and Hand tool <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosirnik/KK_MainGameVR/master/doc/img/icon_hand.png" height="30">

These tools are collections of Koikatsu-specific action commands and simulated
mouse/keyboard inputs. The hand tool is for H scenes, and the school tool is for
all other scenes. Other than that, these two are similar to each other. The
button mappings are configurable for each of them separately.
The default for the school tool is:

* Trigger: Walk (Roam mode)
* Grip: Grab action
* Touchpad up: F3
* Touchpad down: F1
* Touchpad left: Turn left
* Touchpad right: Turn right
* Touchpad center: Right mouse button

For the hand tool:

* Trigger: Left mouse button
* Grip: Grab action
* Touchpad up: Mouse wheel scroll up
* Touchpad down: Mouse wheel scroll down
* Touchpad left: (unassigned)
* Touchpad right: Right mouse button
* Touchpad center: Middle mouse button

For touchpad inputs, you need to press the touchpad or click the thumbstick.
Just touching the touchpad or tilting the thumbstick won't be recognized.
Exceptions to this rule are mouse wheel scroll actions and rotate actions,
which only require touching.

## Configuration

**Warning: This section was written for KK_MainGameVR and might not be accurate, especially in Studio.**

This plugin has a lot of configuration options. It is recommended that you use
[ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager),
which allows you to change settings of this plugin from within the game.

## Controller Support

At the moment, most VR controllers seem to work out of the box with this plugin.
Below is an incomplete list of the current support status. If your controllers
are not listed here, please let us know if they work or not (either edit this 
file or create a new issue).

### Works out of the box
* Oculus Rift / Rift S / Quest 2
* Valve Index
* Vive

### HTC Vive

Works out of the box.

### HP motion controllers

The following button assignments are needed:

* Enumlated trackpad: (remove assignments)
* B and Y buttons: Application Menu Button
* Joystick: Trackpad position & value

In addition, you need to make it "pretend to be Oculus Touch controllers".

## Common issues

### Can't click on the virtual screen

This plugin requires that the game window on the Windows desktop is visible and
not covered by something else.

### Framerate is low

If you experience a framerate drop when the camera approaches a character,
particularly in an H scene, then the bottleneck is likely your GPU. I'd suggest
turning down the antialiasing setting using the
[GraphicsSettings](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.GraphicsSettings) plugin.
If that is not enough, consider disabling some visual effects or reducing the rendering
resolution in SteamVR.

If you experience a low framerate when roaming in main game, try disabling expensive plugins 
or reducing the number of characters that can be loaded at the same time (on left in roster).

## Building (for developers)

You should be able to open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 and just hit Build to build everything.
